    "# Project Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "By: Sam Vanturennout and Cooper Braun\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Name\n",
    "\n",
    "Loan Approval Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the Loan Approval Dataset from Kaggle (CSV).\n",
    "Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anishdevedward/loan-approval-dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains loan applications with attributes such as applicant name, city, credit score, annual income, loan amount, years employed, calculated risk factor, and whether the loan was approved.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Class attribute: Loan_Approved (approved vs. not approved).\n",
    "* Features we will use: City, Credit Score, Annual Income, Loan Amount, Years Employed, Risk Factor.\n",
    "* Features to drop: Name (identifier, no predictive value).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation / Technical Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform:\n",
    "\n",
    "* EDA: Summaries, distributions, class balance.\n",
    "* Preprocessing: Drop non-informative attributes, encode City, check for missing values, scale numeric features if needed.\n",
    "* Models: Baseline (majority class) + Decision Tree, k-NN, and/or Logistic Regression.\n",
    "* Evaluation: Train/test split or cross-validation; accuracy and precision/recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anticipated Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "* Class imbalance: May require stratified splits and comparison with majority baseline.\n",
    "* Uninformative attributes: City may add noise; we will test performance with and without it.\n",
    "* Missing or inconsistent values: Handle by imputation or dropping affected rows.\n",
    "* Correlated features: Risk Factor may duplicate information; we will check correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Selection:**\n",
    "Use correlations, mutual information, and tree-based feature importance to confirm which attributes matter. Remove unhelpful city categories if needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Impact and Stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "A loan-approval predictor can help applicants estimate approval likelihood and help lenders quickly screen applications before manual review. The results may also highlight which factors influence approval decisions most.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stakeholders: loan applicants, financial institutions, and (indirectly) regulators concerned with fairness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Citations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Anish Dev Edward, Loan Approval Dataset, Kaggle.\n",
    "* Scikit-learn documentation (for methodology reference).\n",
    "* Reused code from PA's or previous course materials will be cited in the final notebook."
